Call for Participation
LxMLS 2019 - 9th Lisbon Machine Learning School
==============================================================

We invite everyone interested in Machine Learning and Natural Language 
Processing to attend the 9th Lisbon Machine Learning School - LxMLS 2019.

Important Dates
---------------
* Application Deadline: March 31, 2019
* Decision: April 30, 2019
* Early Registration: May 6 - June 7, 2019
* Summer School: July 11 - 18, 2019


Topics and Intended Audience
---------------
The school will cover a range of Machine Learning (ML) topics, from theory to 
practice, that are important in solving Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
problems that arise in the analysis and use of Web data.

Our target audience is:
* Researchers and graduate students in the fields of NLP and Computational 
Linguistics;
* Computer scientists who have interests in statistics and machine learning;
* Industry practitioners who desire a more in depth understanding of these 
subjects.

Features of LxMLS:
* No deep previous knowledge of ML or NLP is required, but the attendants are 
assumed to have some basic background on mathematics and programming;
* Days are divided into morning lectures and afternoon lab sessions and 
practical talks (see schedule);
* The Labs guide will be provided one month in advance. Last years guide are 
available in the website.
* A day zero is scheduled to review basic concepts and introduce the necessary 
tools for implementation exercises
* Both basic (e.g linear classifiers) and advanced topics (e.g. deep learning, 
reinforcement learning) will be covered
* Students will be able to (optionally) show their current work in poster 
sessions during coffee breaks
* In the demo day students will be able to interact with technical companies 
and research institutions working in machine learning
* Welcome reception, Gala dinner, daily lunch as well as morning and afternoon 
coffee breaks are included in the application fee
* Lecturers are leading researchers in machine learning and natural language 
processing
