  Abstract                 = {Sentiment Analysis deals with the computational treatment of senti- ment in texts. The recent interest for sentiment analysis has grown due the popularity of internet and the increase of user-generated contents, such as blogs, social networks and reviews websites. This work understands sentiment analysis as a classification prob- lem. In this problem, a text can be classified as positive or negative. Sentiment classifiers can be distinguished by twomain approaches: ma- chine learning and lexicon-based. The machine learning approach uses a corpus to automatically learn the best classification features. The lexicon-based approach uses a previously computed dictionary with the sentiment lexicon. Discourse is a linguistic level of analysis where the author represents ideas and links concepts in a rational chain of thoughts. One important representation of discourse is the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). This theory organizes the discourse in 26 relations that hierarchically represent the text discourse. This objective of this work is to use discourse knowledge to improve a lexicon-based sentiment classifier. To achieve this goal it proposes the SO-RST, a lexicon-based algorithm that weights portions of text under particular RST relations distinctly. Two experiments are re- ported. The first experiment verifies if the RST improves sentiment classification. It also shows the discourse relations which are most im- portant in the process. The second experiment incorporates discourse markers in the algorithm in order to eliminate the necessity of a RST annotated corpus. It uses the weights learned in the first experiment to perform the sentiment classification. The results obtained showed which RST relations most help the lexicon-based classifier to achieve a better accuracy. The discourse markers introduced in the algorithm showed some directions to follow and the necessary steps to better study this technique.},

  Abstract                 = {Web 2.0 has allowed a never imagined communication boom. With the widespread use of computational and mobile devices, anyone, in practically any language, may post comments in the web. As such, formal language is not necessarily used. In fact, in these communicative situations, language is marked by the absence of more complex syntactic structures and the presence of internet slang, with missing diacritics, repetitions of vowels, and the use of chat-speak style abbreviations, emoticons and colloquial expressions. Such language use poses severe new challenges for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and applications, which, so far, have focused on well-written texts. In this work, we report the construction of a large web corpus of product reviews in Brazilian Portuguese and the analysis of its lexical phenomena, which support the development of a lexical normalization tool for, in future work, subsidizing the use of standard NLP products for web opinion mining and summarization purposes.},

  Abstract                 = {At times choosing a product can be a difficult task due to the fact that customers need to consider many features before they can reach a decision. Interactive question answering (IQA) systems can help customers in this process, by answering questions about products and initiating a dialogue with the customer when their needs are not clearly defined. For this purpose we propose a corpus-based method for weighting the importance of product features depending on how likely they are to be of interest for a user. By using this method, we hope that users can select the desired product in an optimal way. For the experiments a corpus of user reviews is used, the assumption being that the features mentioned in a review are probably more important for a person who is likely to purchase a product. To improve the method, a sentiment classification system is also employed to distinguish between features mentioned in positive and negative contexts. Evaluation shows that the ranking method that incorporates this information is one of the best performing ones.},

This doctoral dissertation details an empirical study of techniques and methods for aspect extraction in aspect-based sentiment analysis with the focus on Portuguese. Three different approaches were explored: frequency-based, relation-based and machine learning. In each one, this work shows a comparative study between a Portuguese and an English corpora and the differences found in applying the approaches. In addition, richer linguistic knowledge is also explored by using syntatic dependencies and semantic roles, leading to better results.
